# CLOUD: BASICS

## Cloud Servers (VPS)
- cloud: internet infrastructure that could be used remotely.
- cloud servers: virtual machines provide computing resources (processing, memory, and storage) that could be used remotely.
- bare-metal servers: real physical servers, not virtualized.
- ssh protocol: used on port 22 for remote server secure connection.
- services like (headless CMS, serverless) are for hosting static websites.

## Cloud Software
- operating system
- web server: serves static and dynamic contents to clients using HTTP protocol.
- API server: a software mediary that allows applications to communicate with one another.
- Database server: a software that manages the database and uses a databse query language.

## Cloud Computing
- cloud computing: the delivery of computing resources (processing, storage, servers, networks, applications, services) as a service that can be easily provisioned and released easily and remotely without human interaction.
- cloud services: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS.
- cloud environments: public, private, hybrid and multicloud.

## Cloud Hosting
- host server, os -> hypervisor (deploy, maintain, move, destroy) -> virtual servers.
- hypervisors: Kernel-Based Virtual Machine (KVM), Xen, ESXi, Hyper-V.
- scaling: horizontal (more VPS nodes) vs vertical (more resourses per node).
